# TelescopeDewHeaterController
This is a relatively easy to build automatic dew heater controller for telescopes. It heats the lens/mirror on your telescope to stop the dreaded dew. The drive to the heater is automatically controlled by the difference between the ambient dew point and the current temperature of the heater on your lens/mirror. It can also be set manually if desired.

The build is based on the excellent Dew Heater controller built in IceInSpace 2010 by Bob Stephens.

To make life simpler my project uses the Arduino nano with an extension I/O board. So all the components CAN BE attached with pre-made connectors. There is NO circuit board making. There is NO soldering onto circuit boards. The ONLY soldering is for the plugs and sockets to connect it to the outside world. It is also inexpensive.

For details on the build read the Dew_heater_detailos PDF.

There are 4x Arduino files:
-	3x test files to check the DHT22 sensor, DS18B20 sensor and OLED display are working.
-	The DewHeaterControlledVx-x_LCDdislay files contains the working code for the complete system

You can use commercially available dew straps (although I havenâ€™t tested my system with these, so no responsibility taken), or you can make your own with nichrome wire. I have included instructions for this. I power it all from a standard 12V battery used for telescopes.
