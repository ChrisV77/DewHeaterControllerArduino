# TelescopeDewHeaterController
This is a relatively easy to build for an Arduino based automatic dew heater controller for telescopes. It heats the lens/mirror on your telescope to stop the dreaded dew. 

In this build, the power drive to the heater is automatically controlled by the difference between the ambient dew point and the current temperature of the heater on your lens/mirror. The heater power can also be set manually if desired. 

The display can be a 16x2 LCD, or a 128x64 OLED.
The ambient temperature/humidity sensor can be an AM2320 or a DHT22 (and soon a BME280)
The heater temperture is sensed by a DS18B20

Any arduino can be used, but I use the Nano with an extension I/O board. So all the components can be attached with pre-made connectors. There is NO circuit board making. Just a few resistors oldered here and there

For details on the build read the Dew_heater_details PDF. This has instructions on the build, tesing etc.

You can use commercially available dew straps (although I havenâ€™t tested my system with these, so no responsibility taken), or you can make your own with nichrome wire. I have included instructions for this. I power it all from a standard 12V battery used for telescopes.
